To Test API gateway, and test initial phase of protype I am writing following steps to setup infrastructre in AWS account:

We are using AWS's lamda, gateway, and DynamoDB service in backend application

Steps: 

API gateway:

1. Make API gateway
2. Create "\health" resource with "GET" method (to check if api is working or not)
3. Create "\login" resource with "POST" method 
4. Create "\register" resource with "POST" method 
5. Create "\verify" resource with "POST" method (to check token) 
	  
NOTE : I am not using any API key for API Gateway at the moment but u guys can use for security purpose


AWS lamda:

1. Create a function with Node js 14.x version
2. Add zip code from backend file in github repo branch - (Darshan-L00171222)
3. Change userTable variable in login.js or Register.js with with DynamoDB table name

DynamoDB:

1. Create a table with Partition key - username
